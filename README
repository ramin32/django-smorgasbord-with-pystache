Summary
=======

Smorgasbord is a Django application that provides transparent support
for multiple templating languages in Django, even for 3rd party
applications that don't use your choice of template language natively.
Using Smorgasbord, you can use templates written in a different
language with applications written to Django's own high-level
templating API.

Motivation
==========

The goal of Smorgasbord is to be able to use alternative template
languages not only to write new code, but to customize the templates
used by 3rd party applications whose views use Django's template API
(in particular, ``render_to_response`` and ``render_to_string``, which
use the loading mechanism in ``django.template.loader``).  This goal
requires some patching to Django itself, implemented here as
the monkeypatching of one function.

Django developers have, it seems, generally not been very interested
in supporting multiple template engines in the django core; the
argument goes that you can always simply call another engine's API
from a view, and hence no support is necessary.  For one (very
reasonable) statement of this argument, see:

  http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_thread/thread/f41b2434fc2ca5c9/645592cb23bc49ed

The problem remains, however, that if a view uses
``render_to_response`` it is (normally) tied to Django's own
templating engine.  A rich ecosystem has emerged of reusable Django
applications, which are almost always coupled with Django's built-in
templating in this way; and if you want to use them in your projects,
you probably will need to customize their templates, and in many cases
have those templates inherit global characteristics of your site such
as navigation.  That means that if you want to use an alternative
engine, and also want to use 3rd party apps, you really have little
latitude with regard to templating engine choice unless you wish to
patch or monkeypatch the individual applications themselves, or create
equivalent base templates written in different template languages,
both of which alternatives are unpalatable and impose a heavy
maintainance burden.

Monkeypatching in any form is somewhat unhygienic.  But smorgasbord's
is directed at a very small and focussed part of the framework itself,
and should hopefully involve less headache to end users.


Usage
=====

Add to a file that will be imported in your project, such as
``settings.py`` or ``urls.py``, this code::

  import smorgasbord
  smorgasbord.monkeypatch()

This will replace ``django.template.loader.get_template`` with
smorgasbord's template-language-multiplexing equivalent.

Then assign to the configuration variable ``TEMPLATE_LANGUAGES``
a tuple of languages you want to use, e.g.::
 
  TEMPLATE_LANGUAGES=('django', 'mako', 'jinja2')

For each language (except ``django``, which already uses
``TEMPLATE_DIRS`` for this purpose) in that tuple, define a tuple of
directories you want searched::

  MAKO_TEMPLATE_DIRS=('/home/smulloni/smorgasbordtest/templates/mako',)
  JINJA2_TEMPLATE_DIRS=('/home/smulloni/smorgasbordtest/templates/jinja2',)

The variable name should always be the template language name,
uppercased, plus ``_TEMPLATE_DIRS``. 

To pass additional options to the template engine, define a variable
``<ENGINENAME>_TEMPLATE_OPTS``.  For instance::

  MAKO_TEMPLATE_OPTS=dict(
    input_encoding='utf-8',
    module_directory=os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(),
                                  os.environ['LOGNAME'],
                                  'makotemplates'))


When Django looks for a file-based template using its modified
template loading machinery, it take the languages in
``settings.TEMPLATE_LANGUAGES`` in order, and for each language find
the corresponding list of directories to search in.  If it finds a
template of the right name, it returns an object compatible with the
``django.template.Template`` API (namely, with a compatible
``render()`` method).


Limitations 
===========

Most views do nothing with templates other than specify a context and
call ``render_to_response`` or ``render_to_string``.  The goal is for
these views to work fine with Smorgasbord.  But views that dig deeper
into the Django template API will not work.

Any transparent support of templating languages requires some
trade-offs; the different APIs provided by different languages have
something to do with underlying differences in their feature sets.
Some support for engine-specific customization is on the roadmap.

Supported Languages 
===================

Currently mako is fully supported and tested.

A less sure level of support is available for:

    * jinja2
    * cheetah
    * STML 

Patches to improve engine support would be welcome.
